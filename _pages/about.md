I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Iceland (Reykjavik, Iceland) in the Icelandic Vision Lab. 

My research primarily focuses on visual perception, attention, and cognition, with a particular emphasis on understanding the variability in cognitive processes among individuals. I aim to uncover how these differences are linked to underlying neural mechanisms. 

To achieve this, I employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates behavioural experiments, electrophysiological recordings, and self-report measures. By combining these methodologies, I strive to gain a comprehensive understanding of the neural and psychological factors that contribute to individual differences in cognitive processing.
