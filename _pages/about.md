I am a current PhD candidate at Brock University (St. Catharines, Canada) in the Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience stream of the Psychology program where I was awarded the Alexander Graham Bell Doctoral Scholarship (CGS D). I work under the supervision of Dr. Karen Arnell in the Attention Lab. 

My research interests largely revolve around better understanding motivation, emotion and attention, and the relationships between them. I am particularly interested in understanding why people differ in their cognition, and whether these differences are associated with underlying electrophysiology and personality characteristics. In my research, I use a combination of behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report measures.
