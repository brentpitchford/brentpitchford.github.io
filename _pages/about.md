I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Iceland (Reykjavik, Iceland) in the Icelandic Vision Lab. 

My research interests largely revolve around better understanding perception, attention, and cognition more generally, and the connection between neural activity and cognitive processing. I am particularly interested in understanding why people differ in their cognition, and whether these differences are associated with underlying electrophysiology and personality characteristics. In my research, I use a combination of behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report measures.
