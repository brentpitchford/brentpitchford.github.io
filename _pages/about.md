I am a current PhD candidate at Brock University (St. Catharines, Canada) in the Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience stream of the Psychology program where I was awarded the Alexander Graham Bell Doctoral Scholarship (CGS D). I work under the supervision of Dr. Karen Arnell in the Attention Lab. Before coming to Brock, I completed by BSc in Psychology at Carleton University in Ottawa. During my time at Carleton, I volunteered in Dr. John Zelenski's Happiness Lab and completed an honour's thesis with Dr. John Logan examining speech patterns in youth with psychopathic tendencies.

My research interests largely revolve around better understanding motivation, emotion and attention, and the relationships between them. I am particularly interested in understanding why people differ in their cognition, and whether these differences are associated with underlying electrophysiology and personality characteristics. In my research, I use a combination of behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report measures.
