Hello! Welcome to my site. I am a current PhD candidate at Brock University in the Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience stream of the Psychology program. My research interests largely revolve around better understanding motivation, emotion and attention, and the relationships between them. I use a combination of behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report measures in my research.
