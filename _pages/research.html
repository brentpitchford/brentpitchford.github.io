My research focuses on cognitive processes such as visual attention. I am interested in examining individual differences in cognition to investigate why people differ from one another in how they perceive, attend to, and interact with their environment. I am also interested in how motivation and emotion influence cognition, including how previous experience with highly motivational or emotional stimuli can influence future cognition. I use a combination of behavioural, electrophysiological and self-report measures in my research.
